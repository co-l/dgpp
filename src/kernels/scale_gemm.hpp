// Scale-aware GEMM (DESIGN §4): consumes the resident compressed form of a
// quantized weight — E4M3 payload [N, K] plus F32 128x128 block scales —
// natively, with no BF16 materialization of the weight. The block scale is
// applied inside the weight-tile load path (decode x scale, one BF16
// round), producing weight tiles bit-identical to the transient dequant
// bridge; the MMA runs bf16 x bf16 with fp32 accumulation — the pinned
// reference numerics (dequantized weights, bf16 math), not DeepSeek-style
// dynamic activation quantization, which would change the semantics the
// M2/M3 references pinned.
//
//   D[M, N] = Act[M, K] x W[N, K]^T
//
// Tile geometry (BM=16, BN=64, BK=32) divides the 128-wide scale block
// exactly, so every stage applies one scalar scale (no per-element scale
// gather) and ragged N/K tails — anything not a multiple of 128 — read the
// true last block row/col with masked tile loads. Decode shapes up to eight
// rows use row-independent GEMV chunks, keeping each row bitwise invariant
// to serving occupancy. Both paths are deterministic and graph-capturable.

// before 2026-09-14). The chunks read the weights once per four rows; the
// streaming form once for every row count (m = 16 on the full GLM-5.3 DSA

// chunks (ahead of the streaming form's 128-row groups from 512 rows: 1060
// against 1099 us, 3479 against 4355 at 2048). The families pass
// dense_gemv_rows() + 1 (kernels/gemm.hpp): the GEMV chunks to four rows —
// the one-row floor and the fused multi-problem launches — the streaming
// form above. A row's chain is the chunk core's under the bound, the

// other, so a site's rows reorder across the bounds (the engine gates'
