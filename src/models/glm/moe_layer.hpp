// MoE execution for diagnostic, decode and prefill workloads.
//
// enqueue() runs host segmentation after reading back router IDs and
// weights, then gathers expert inputs and applies each expert in order.
// enqueue_decode() keeps routes and expert views on the device and uses
// slot kernels without a host synchronization. The grouped prefill path
// segments rows on the device and uses GEMV or tensor-core kernels.
//
// Every TP rank holds an intermediate slice of each expert. Partial down
// projections remain in FP32, with one fma per expert in ascending ID order
// and the shared expert last. The chain rounds to BF16 once before the
// FFN all-reduce. This differs from the reference's per-expert BF16
// roundings; glm_moe_reference implements the same accumulation rule in
// double precision, and tests compare execution paths.
//
// Route traces use caller-owned pinned staging and asynchronous copies.
// Read them after the model stream completes; see MoeTraceStaging and
// models/glm/trace.hpp.
